"Magrepack" provides players with the ability to repack magazines. It was written by Skamdrept and Badger 2-3, and originally published under the name "SESOF MagRepack."

# Usage
Open the inventory and drag "Magazine 1" onto "Magazine 2" to transfer rounds to the latter. If "Magazine 1" is emptied in the process, it will be dropped on the ground.

# Compatability
Does not work on consoles unless you hook up a mouse so you can drag and drop items from specific slots to specific slots in the inventory.
