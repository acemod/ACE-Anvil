**ACE Anvil** is an experimental realism mod for Arma Reforger, the first Arma game running on the Enfusion engine.

**ACE Anvil is available on the Arma Reforger Workshop:**
- <a href={config.ace.workshopUrl} target="_blank">**All in One**</a> _(recommended)_
- <a href={config.ace.workshopUrlSearch} target="_blank">**Individual components**</a>

### Features

A goal of ACE Anvil is to provide realism and quality of life features. Like the creators of the Arma series, Bohemia Interactive, we want to treat Arma Reforger as a test platform for the Enfusion engine. As such, we are happy to add some features that might not be strictly within ACE's usual scope.

### Modularity

Previous ACE projects were already modular in the sense that a user could remove the components they did not want. ACE Anvil takes this a step further: every component is **published separately** on the Workshop along with **ACE All in One**, which provides a one-click solution to subscribing to all of ACE components.

Every component requires at least **ACE Core**, but may require other components as well.

### Contributing

We welcome any contribution that fits within ACE's scope. That means anything that is either a realism or just quality of life feature is much appreciated. Ideally, hop on <a href={config.ace.discordUrl} target="_blank">our Discord</a> and discuss what you want to do with the community first.

As always, we aim to provide a high quality and performant mod for all Arma Reforger players to enjoy. Pull requests will be reviewed in detail and only merged once we are satisfied with the standards we have set.
