**ACE Medical** overhauls the medical system with the aim to make it more engaging for medics. It is highly configurable, allowing communities to tailor the experience from casual to realistic. ACE Medical is split into multiple mods for increased modularity:

- [ACE Medical Core](#ace-medical-core)
- [ACE Medical Hitzones](#ace-medical-hitzones)
- [ACE Medical Circulation](#ace-medical-circulation)
- ~~[ACE Medical Defibrillation](#ace-medical-defibrillation)~~
- ~~[ACE Medical Breathing](#ace-medical-breathing)~~

## ACE Medical Core

### Overview

**ACE Medical Core** provides the backbone for all medical mods and comes with the following features:

- **Second Chance**: Increases survivability by ensuring that players fall unconscious instead of getting killed outright.
- **Pain**: Injuries cause pain screen effects and can be treated with morphine
- **Medication**:
    - Changed: Morphine can only be used for treating pain and has no longer healing effects
    - Added: Epinephrine for speeding up wake-up of unconscious patients
- **Repositioning**: Allows putting patients on their back or in recovery position
- Medical radial menu for putting medical items to hand
- Additional settings for configuring medical kits, bleedings, _etc._

### Details

#### Resilience

Resilience is a health pool from vanilla with 100 HP that is closely linked to consciousness. It takes indirectly damage passed from body parts and armor. A player falls unconscious when HP < 33 and wakes up when HP > 75. HP is either recovered through passive regeneration or with epinephrine. The passive recovery rate is +5 HP/s and can be scaled with `m_fDefaultResilienceRegenScale` respective `m_fSecondChanceResilienceRegenScale` (see [Settings](#settings)). Note that passive recovery only starts when no damage was taken for 10 seconds.

#### Second Chance

Second chance gets evaluated when a player would have been killed in vanilla without falling unconscious first. If granted, the player will survive, but falls unconscious with a distinct recovery rate (see `m_fSecondChanceResilienceRegenScale` in [Settings](#settings)). Depending on the settings, epinephrine is mandatory to wake up patients that got second chance granted. The evaluation of second chance is probabilistic and can be configured per body part.

#### Medical Kit

While a vanilla feature, newcomers might not be aware that it can be put in hand for healing body parts of patients. Depending on the settings, healing requires supplies and full healing can only be done near ambulances and medical facilities. Unlike vanilla, it is the only way to actively heal body parts. It is therefore crucial for treating arm and leg injuries, which can make aiming and walking difficult otherwise. Depending on the settings, it may also be required to heal up players before being able to apply epinephrine.

### Treatments

    <PlantUML src="/plantumls/medical/core-treatment-2.puml" alt="core-treatment-2.puml" />
</div>

### Usage

#### Reposition Patient

- Unconscious patients have a user interaction on their abdomen for changing to back or recovery position.

#### Medical Radial Menu

- Open medical radial menu with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> (ACE default)

## ACE Medical Hitzones

### Overview

<Image src={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}images/medical/organic-hit-zones.png`} alt="organic-hit-zones.png" width="200px" height="200px" align="right" />

**ACE Medical Hitzones** overhauls hit zones and has the following features:

- **Organ Hit Zones**: New hit zones that can only be hit with melee and projectiles:
    - **Heart**: Evaluated for second chance
    - **Femoral arteries**: Cause massive bleedings
- Removes global health in favor of evaluating second chance on destruction of vital body parts (head and torso)
- Improves bleeding effect of massive bleedings


### Details

#### Removal of Global Health

In vanilla, there is a global health pool that takes damage passed from body parts. If HP of this health pool drops to 0, second chance gets evaluated. ACE Medical Hitzones gets completely rid of this health pool and evaluates second chance instead when HP of a vital body part drops to 0.

## ACE Medical Circulation

### Overview

**ACE Medical Circulation** adds the following features:
- **Vitals**:
    - Simulation of heart rate and blood pressure
    - Cardiac arrest state and CPR for revival
- **Medication**:
    - Removes all "training wheels", _i.e._ drugs can always be administered and overdosed
    - Exchanges epinephrine with ammonium carbonate. Epinephrine has now a different role.
    - New types of drugs
    - Advanced simulation of drug effects and their evolution over time
- **Second chance**:
    - When second chance is granted, the patient goes into cardiac arrest
- Hit Zones:
    - New brain hit zone that takes continuously damage while in cardiac arrest and no CPR is performed. Runs out of health in approximately 5 minutes.

The changes are also applied to AI, but they will directly die when they enter cardiac arrest (see `m_bCardiacArrestForAIEnabled` in [Settings](#settings-2)).

### Details

#### Glossary

- BP: Blood pressure
- HR: Heart rate
- OD: Overdose
- $t_{max}$: Time until maximum effect
- $t_{½}$: Time until effect diminishes to 50% of maximum effect (relative to administration time, not $t_{max}$)
- $TD_{50}$: Number of doses at which 50% of patients fall unconscious
- $LD_{50}$: Number of doses at which 50% of patients experience cardiac arrest

#### Medications

All currently available forms of medications are summarized in the table below:

| Name | Effects | $t_{max}$	| $t_{½}$ | $TD_{50}$ | $LD_{50}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ammonium carbonate package | <ul><li>Wakes up stable unconscious patients</li></ul> | 2-3 s | 3-4 s | --- | --- |
| Epinephrine injector | <ul><li>Increases revive chance</li><li>Increases HR</li><li>Increases BP</li></ul> | 23 s | 1 min 3 s | --- | 4.4 |
| Metoprolol injector | <ul><li>Decreases HR</li><li>Decreases BP</li></ul> | 25 s | 1 min 9 s | 2.8 | > 3 |
| Morphine injector | <ul><li>Suppresses pain</li><li>Decreases HR</li><li>Decreases BP</li></ul> | 1 min 57 s | 15 min 20 s | 3.1 | 3.8 |
| Naloxone injector | <ul><li>Treats morphine OD</li></ul> | 1 min 35 s | 7 min 26 s | --- | --- |
| Phenylephrine injector | <ul><li>Slows down bleeding and transfusion</li><li>Increases BP</li></ul> | 29 s | 1 min 18 s | --- | 2.9 |

#### Vital Ranges

Blood volumes are categorized into six classes:
- Normal
- Class I hemorrhage (lost < 30%)
- Class II hemorrhage (lost 30%)
- Class III hemorrhage (lost 60%)
- Class IV hemorrhage (lost 80%)
- Fatal (lost 100%)

The values of the vitals (_e.g._ HR and BP) are essential for getting a patient back up. While in cardiac arrest, only CPR may get the patient back up, but the success chance can be increased with epinephrine. A patient falls unconscious if either their resilience falls below 34/100 or their vital state is at least critical. Resilience will automatically recover if the vitals are stable, but can be speeded up with ammonium carbonate (_i.e._ like epinephrine in ACE Medical). Ammonium carbonate has no effect as long as the vitals aren't stable.

| State | HR [BPM] | BP [mmHg] | Hemorrhage class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiac arrest | > 220 | > 284/189 | --- |
| Stable | 40 - 220 | 69/46 - 284/189 | < II |
| Unstable | < 40 | < 69/46 | II |
| Critical | < 30 | < 51/34 | III |
| Cardiac arrest | < 20 | < 51/34* | IV |

\* BP below 51/34 mmHg only leads to cardiac arrest if the heart rate is at least critical (_i.e._ < 30 BPM).
