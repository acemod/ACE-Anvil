## Pull Request process

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or [Discord](https://acemod.org/discord) with the [ACE Anvil project managers](https://anvil.acemod.org/team.html) before making a change. This may not be necessary if you are contributing for something which has an existing issue in our repository already.

1. You should fork from and create pull requests (PR) to either `master` or a feature branch of an another PR if you need it as dependency. Do not fork from or PR to `dev`, as it is merely used by us for compiling a preview of PRs.
1. Please make a PR as early as possible. This let us help you in the proces of developing it. When opening a work in progress pull request, use GitHub's draft feature. This will mark the PR as a work in progress and will prevent it from being merged until you mark it as ready for review.
2. Describe what this pull request will do and how it solves this in the description of your PR. A clear intent and description of the way the issue is resolved will help us to review the PR more efficiently.
3. Please follow our [Development Guidelines](https://anvil.acemod.org/guides/development/). 

### Notes

Please note that all contributors to this project are volunteers and do this in their own time. This means that issues and/or PRs may be open for a long time before being picked up and reviewed. We try to keep this time as short as possible, but some times things may fall short. If you feel that an issue or PR has not received attention, please comment asking for a review using the mention `@acemod/maintainers`.
