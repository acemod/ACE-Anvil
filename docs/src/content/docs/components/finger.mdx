  author="Kex"
/>

Allows players to point in a direction with their fingers, when they do so people around (10 m by default) can see a ping in the pointed direction.

## Usage

### Point at Positions and Objects

- Use the `Point with finger briefly` keybind in `Character` category (Default: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>~</kbd>)

## Settings

Certain aspects of this mod can be configured in the mission header section of a server config file. An overview of available fields is given below in the table:

| Field                   | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| m_fMaxPointingDistanceM | float** | 1000.0  | Maximum pointing distance in meters.                                                           |
| m_bCanPingAttach        | bool*   | true    | Whether the ping can attach to entities.                                                       |
| m_fPingRangeM           | float** | 10.0    | Range of the ping in meters. Only players in range will see it. Anyone can see it if negative. |

\* Note that bool has to be provided as integer in the config: 1 (true) or 0 (false).<br>
\*\* Note that floats need a decimal point to get properly read.

Example for the `missionHeader` in a server config:
```
"missionHeader": {
    "m_ACE_Settings": {
        "m_ACE_Finger_Settings": {
            "m_fMaxPointingDistanceM": 1000.0,
            "m_bCanPingAttach": 1,
            "m_fPingRangeM": 10.0
        }
    }
}
```
