Adds channel-specific beep sounds from ACRE2 when starting a radio transmission. Also adds KYK-13 Fill Device for copying custom encryption keys to radios.

## Details

### KYK-13 Fill Device

A small device used for transferring cryptographic keys to radios. It can only be used if the server has [`VONCanTransmitCrossFaction`](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_Reforger:Server_Config#VONCanTransmitCrossFaction) enabled, as otherwise you cannot transmit over non-default encrypted channels.

## Usage

### Load KYK-13 with an encryption key set

- Equip the KYK-13 and interact with the stationary radio on a friendly command post
- You can choose between various key sets, where a set consists of 6 keys that get simultaneously loaded


### Copy encryption key from KYK-13 to another KYK-13 or radio

- Drop the device you want to copy a key to on the floor
- Equip the loaded KYK-13 and interact with the device on the floor to copy the key
- You can select a different key from the key set for copying by inspecting the KYK-13 and change the address

### Clear all keys from KYK-13

- There is a clear all action when you inspect the KYK-13
