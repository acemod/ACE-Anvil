Allows players to point on a position with their finger. When they do so, nearby players (10 m by default) can see a ping.

## Usage

### Point at Positions and Objects

- Use the `Point with finger briefly` keybind in `Character` category (Default: <kbd>LCtrl</kbd>+<kbd>~</kbd>)

### Point at Position on Map

- Hover with the mouse over the position on the map and hold <kbd>LCtrl</kbd> (ACE default)

## Settings

Certain aspects of this mod can be configured in the mission header section of a server config file. An overview of available fields is given below in the table:

| Field                                 | Value                | Description                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `m_fMaxPointingDistanceM`             | Type: `float`**<br />Range: 0 to ∞<br />Default: `1000.0` | Maximum pointing distance in meters. |
| `m_bCanPingAttach`                    | Type: `bool`*<br />Default: `true` | Whether the ping can attach to entities. |
| `m_fPingRangeM`                       | Type: `float`**<br />Range: -1 to ∞<br />Default: `10.0` | Range of the ping in meters. Only players in range will see it. Anyone can see it if negative. |
| `m_fMapPointingRangeM`                | Type: `float`**<br />Range: -1 to ∞<br />Default: `10.0` | Range of map pointing in meters. Only players in range will see it. Anyone can see it if negative. |

\* Note that bool has to be provided as integer in the config: 1 (true) or 0 (false).<br />
\*\* Note that floats need a decimal point to get properly read.

Example for the `missionHeader` in a server config:
```
"missionHeader": {
    "m_ACE_Settings": {
        "m_ACE_Finger_Settings": {
            "m_fMaxPointingDistanceM": 1000.0,
            "m_bCanPingAttach": 1,
            "m_fPingRangeM": 10.0,
            "m_fMapPointingRangeM": 10.0
        }
    }
}
```
